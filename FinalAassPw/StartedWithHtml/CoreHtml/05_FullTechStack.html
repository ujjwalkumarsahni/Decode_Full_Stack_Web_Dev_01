    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stack</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML/CSS</dt>
        <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies used to create and style the structure and layout of web pages.</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a scripting language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to create responsive, interactive elements like forms, sliders, and animations.</dd>

        <dt>React.js</dt>
        <dd>React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.</dd>

        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server side. It is commonly used for building scalable, real-time, and event-driven web applications.</dd>

        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to create APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses.</dd>

        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is widely used in full stack development for its scalability, ease of use, and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data.</dd>

        <dt>SQL</dt>
        <dd>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows developers to retrieve, manipulate, and store data in a structured format using tables and relationships between them.</dd>

        <dt>Git</dt>
        <dd>Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes to their codebase, collaborate with other developers, and manage multiple versions of their projects.</dd>

        <dt>Docker</dt>
        <dd>Docker is a platform used to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It ensures that applications run consistently across different environments, making development and deployment more efficient.</dd>

        <dt>Nginx</dt>
        <dd>Nginx is a web server that can also function as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is often used in full stack development to serve static content, manage web traffic, and improve the performance of web applications.</dd>
