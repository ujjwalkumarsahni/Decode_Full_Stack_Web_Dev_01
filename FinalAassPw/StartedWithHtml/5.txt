What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
DOCTYPE Declaration:

The DOCTYPE declaration is a preamble at the beginning of an HTML document that tells the web browser what version of HTML the page is written in.
In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration is <!DOCTYPE html>. It ensures that the browser renders the page in standards mode, which is important for consistent and correct rendering of the page.
